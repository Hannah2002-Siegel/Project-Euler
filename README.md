# Project-Euler
My solutions and code to the challenges on projecteuler.net with challenge description and solution commentary. Project Euler is a website that has over 1000 math based challenges and problems, which are meant to challenge and develop the users skills in mathematics as well as programming. Any programming language can be used and each challenge has a "one minute rule", meaning that all challenges can we solved with a program that compiles and produces a solution within at most one minute.
